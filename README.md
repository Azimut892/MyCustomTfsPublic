- HTTP: `http://localhost:5064`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Models
- **ApplicationUser**: Extended Identity user with team relationships
- **TaskItem**: Core task entity with states and assignments
- **Team**: Team management with manager-member relationships
- **ProjectModel**: Project organization for tasks
- **UserRoleViewModel**: Role management view model

### Services
- **UserService**: User and role management operations
- **TaskService**: Task CRUD operations and analytics
- **TeamService**: Team management and member operations
- **ProjectService**: Project management operations
- **DropdownService**: Utility service for dropdown lists
- **EnumService**: Enum handling utilities

### Key Features
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction via Entity Framework
- **Dependency Injection**: All services properly registered
- **Database Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships with cascade behaviors

## üîí Security Features

- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Manager and user role distinctions
- **Data Protection**: Entity Framework data protection integration
- **Secure Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints and cascade behaviors

## üö¢ Docker Support

The application includes Docker support. Use the Container (Dockerfile) launch profile to run in Docker:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t mycustomtfs .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 mycustomtfs
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Relationships
- Users belong to Teams (optional)
- Teams have Managers (required)
- Tasks can be assigned to Users
- Tasks can belong to Projects
- Tasks inherit Team from assigned User

### Task States
- **New**: Newly created tasks
- **Defined**: Tasks with clear requirements
- **In Work**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Finished tasks

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üìù Usage Examples

### Creating a Task
Tasks are automatically associated with the assignee's team and can be linked to projects for better organization.

### Managing Teams
Teams consist of a manager and multiple members. Tasks assigned to team members are automatically associated with their team.

### Project Organization
Projects serve as containers for related tasks, providing better organization and tracking capabilities.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Database Migrations
When making model changes:
1. Update your model classes
2. Run `Add-Migration "DescriptiveChangeDescription"`
3. Review the generated migration
4. Run `Update-Database` to apply changes

### Adding New Features
The application follows a clean architecture pattern:
1. Add/modify models in the `Models` folder
2. Create/update service interfaces in `Interfaces`
3. Implement services in the `Services` folder
4. Register services in `ServiceCollectionExtensions`
